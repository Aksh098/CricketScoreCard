# CricketScoreCard
Developed a Java-based Cricket Scorecard application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing. The application captures team details, match configurations (total overs, toss winner, toss decision), and individual player performances (batting and bowling statistics). It calculates and displays comprehensive match results, including strike rates, economy rates, and the winner. Integrated features like background customization, dynamic user input, and both GUI and console-based result displays, emphasizing modular design with multiple classes for scalability and readability.
